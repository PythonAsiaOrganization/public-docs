# Sponsorship Plans

### Sponsorship Period and Payment Details

* **Standard Period**: Each sponsorship period runs annually from January 1st to December 31st.

* **Prorated Fees**: If a company chooses to become a sponsor partway through the year, the sponsorship fee will be prorated based on the number of remaining months in the year. This ensures that companies are only charged for the time during which they benefit from the sponsorship.


This setup encourages companies to join at any time during the year while maintaining the value and attractiveness of the sponsorship throughout different stages of the fiscal year.

# Reasons for Companies to Sponsor

**Showcase Capability in Handling Offshore Python Projects**

Example: A technology company uses the Python Asia Association sponsorship to highlight their proficiency in Python and their capability to handle complex offshore projects. By being a Gold Sponsor, they prominently display their logo and capabilities on the association's website, attracting attention from international companies looking to outsource.

**Facilitate Recruitment and Networking**

Example: A mid-sized software company, chooses the Silver Sponsorship to gain access to the association's networking events. Through priority event registration, they connect with local talent and potential hires who are active in the Python community, efficiently filling their open roles.

**Secure International Talent**

Example: An expanding startup leverages their Gold Sponsorship to engage directly with community leaders and key figures in the Python programming sphere across Asia. This access helps them to tap into a pool of international talent, facilitating easier and more reliable recruitment for their new overseas offices.

**Promote Corporate Brand as a Community Supporter**

Example: A technology company for its commitment to sustainable software solutions, uses the sponsorship to align itself with the community-oriented values of the Python Asia Association. The sponsorship allows them to not only support the Python community but also to enhance their corporate image as a supporter of educational and professional development initiatives.

**Access to Market Insights and Trends**

Example: As a Gold Sponsor, "Data Driven Decisions", a company specializing in data analytics, receives exclusive reports and insights from the association. These insights include data on market trends, technology adoption rates, and skill analysis within the Python community, helping them to strategically plan their market approach and product development.

These examples can be tailored to the unique value propositions of your association and the specific benefits it offers, making a compelling case for why companies should consider becoming sponsors.
